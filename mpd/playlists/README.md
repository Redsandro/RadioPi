This is my template playlist for easy deployment.
Put this in `mpd`'s playlist directory, usually located at:

```
/var/lib/mpd/playlists/
```

Using the extended m3u playlist type is beneficial for clients like GMPC to know the name of the tracks before actually loading them.
Otherwise you'll just see a list of lame URLs.
